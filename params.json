Useful if you don't want to deal with sendmail/postfix/whatever setups and you want to debug/style email contents on your local environment.\r\nThe logger has the following advantages over other tools:\r\n\r\n - Could be added easily to existing projects without requiring any special 3rd party tool\r\n - Logs emails with detailed (extendable) informations to database, including headers and raw email output\r\n - Logging through re-usable elements (A compatible `Zend_Mail` override and a custom zend mail transport for logging)\r\n - allow adding extra informations before saving to log instance by subscribing to the custom event zenc_emaillogger_send_mail\r\n - restful API to retrieve email details, with formatting capabilities (dump, html, json formats supported), allows retrieving last sent email\r\n\r\n#### How to use\r\n The content's captured by the logger is now only visible via the rest controller. There's a plan to add an admin panel for this in the future.\r\n To retrieve the list of sent mails, visit your browser with this URL:\r\n```\r\n<your host>/emails/rest/list\r\n```\r\n To retrieve the last email which have been sent, just go here:\r\n```\r\n<your host>/emails/rest/read/id/last\r\n```\r\n To retrieve the contents of a specific email you can use the ID of the log record instead of `last`, like `/emails/rest/read/id/1` .\r\n \r\n The REST controller has the ability to change the format of rendering. Just append `?format=<format>` to the end of the URL. Currently available renderers:\r\n - dump (which does a `var_dump()` on the log item's data)\r\n - html (renders the email's HTML content if present)\r\n - json (dumps every data in a friendly format, so you could use this module in your CI)\r\n\r\n##### Configuration options\r\n\r\nThere are two options you can set under **System -> Configuration -> Developer -> Email Logger**:\r\n\r\n- Enabled - enables/disables the functionality\r\n- Enable Passthrough - enables/disables passthrough (when enabled emails are both logged AND sent out)\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION Via Modman - Recommended (https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman)\r\n\r\n#### 1) Install Modman:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash < <(wget -O - https://raw.github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/master/modman-installer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/master/modman-installer)\r\nsource ~/.profile\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2) Install Zenc EmailLogger\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncd [magento root folder]\r\nmodman init\r\nmodman clone https://github.com/technodelight/zenc-email-logger.git\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n - Make sure you've cleaned Magento's cache to enable the new module; hit refresh\r\n\r\n#### How to update\r\n<pre>\r\nmodman update zenc-email-logger\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n - Clean Magento's cache to make sure new changes will be enabled.\r\n - Run setup scripts with n98-magerun\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
